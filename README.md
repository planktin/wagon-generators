# Wagon Template Generator for LocomotiveCMS

This generator is under development, but will soon feature a basic template for [Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/).

## Requirements

You'll need to at least

  * [Install Wagon](http://doc.locomotivecms.com/get-started/install-wagon) for LocomotiveCMS.

## Quickstart

```bash
cd path-to-my-wagon-sites-home
git clone git@github.com:planktin/wagon-generators.git
wagon list_templates --lib=wagon_generators/foundation5.rb
```

Please note this template is still under development and will currently give you an empty wagon site.
